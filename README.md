# Movies
A movie app thing made with [Vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite) and a movie API from [Sample APIs](https://sampleapis.com/movies/).

## Instructions
1. `yarn dev` to develop locally (runs Vite in debug mode for more logging output in the cli)
2. `yarn build` to build for production

### Why?
Why not? Vite is a neat concept and I wanted to make something with it. Not necessarily useful or groundbreaking, but it's something.
